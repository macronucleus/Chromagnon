"""This module contains elementary support for I/O of one- and
two-dimensional numerical arrays to and from plain text files. The
text file format is very simple and used by many other programs as
well:

- each line corresponds to one row of the array

- the numbers within a line are separated by white space

- lines starting with # are ignored (comment lines)

An array containing only one line or one column is returned as a
one-dimensional array on reading. One-dimensional arrays are written
as one item per line.

Numbers in files to be read must conform to Python/C syntax.  For
reading files containing Fortran-style double-precision numbers
(exponent prefixed by D), use the module Scientific.IO.FortranFormat.
